# ACP live Session behavior

The adapter retains a Runtime Host subscription after the first prompt. Cancellation
and close use the subscription's current root identity, including a Turn started by
another Host client while the ACP attachment was idle. Close releases the subscription
and connection-local ownership; it does not delete or archive the durable Session.

ACP v1 message chunks are append-only. Matching replay and prefix extensions are
supported. If a completed or recovered message changes text or thinking that was
already streamed (including clearing it), the adapter rejects the prompt with
JSON-RPC error `-32603` and `error.data.code: unsupported_stream_revision` and requests
a stop of that prompt's exact live root. It never represents a replacement by inventing
a new message ID or reports `end_turn` for that failed projection. The client may
still display the already delivered partial text; ACP v1 cannot retract it. The
Session remains owned and can accept another prompt or be closed.

Local resource links must identify regular files. Filesystem admission rejects
non-regular files, including POSIX FIFOs, before reading their content.

Interaction mapping remains deferred to the next ACP capability increment. If a
pending permission, question, form, sandbox-boundary, or client-capability request
is observed, the adapter rejects the affected prompt with JSON-RPC `-32603` and
`error.data.code: unsupported_interaction` (`error.data.kind` identifies the request).
It retires the attachment and uses the existing failure path to request Stop for
that prompt's exact Host Turn. It does not answer or approve the interaction;
Host remains responsible for settlement. A failed Stop retains the Host diagnostic.
The durable Session remains owned and can be prompted again or closed.
